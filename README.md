# Hugo Dynamic Tabs
This shortcodes allows you to easily add tabs to your markdown files. There is no hardcoded limit to the number of tab groups you can have or the amount of tabs in a tab group. 

Please note, both shortcodes use [Bootstrap Tabs](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/navs/#tabs) but can be changed to fit your needs.

## How to Use

1. Copy or download the two shortcodes files located in **layouts/shortcodes**. 
2. Place both shortcodes in your project's **layouts/shortcodes** folder. 
3. In your markdown file, add the following example code. 
```
{{% tabs tabsTotal="3" tabName1="Tab 1" tabName2="Tab 2" tabName3="Tab 3" %}}
{{% tab tabNum="1" %}}

**Tab 1 Content**

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab tabNum="2" %}}

**Tab 2 Content**

{{% /tab %}}
{{% tab tabNum="3" %}}

**Tab 3 Content**

{{% /tab %}}
{{% /tabs %}}
```

## Shortcodes Explanation

Hugo Dynamic Tabs uses two shortcodes each with their own user-defined variables that generate each tab group and each individual tab within that group. 

### tabs.html

This is the parent shortcodes that wraps around all nested tab shortcodes in the tab group and generates the tab navigation. 

| Variable  | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| tabsTotal | This variable is used to generate the tab navigation. Simply set it to the amount of tab shortcodes you have. In the above example, since there are **three** nested tab shortcodes, you would set tabsTotal to **three**.
| tabNameX  | This variable is used to generate each tab header based on how many nested tab shortcodes there are. Where **X** in the is the next sequential number, always starting at **one**. In the above example, there are **three** nested tab shortcodes so **tabName1**, **tabName2** & **tabName3** were added.  

### tab.html

This is a child shortcode that is nested in the tabs shortcodes. Each tab shortcode equals one tab so add as many as you need. Please note, make sure **tabsTotal** in the tabs shortcode is equal to the amount of tab shortcodes you use. 


| Variable  | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| tabNum    |  This variable relates directly to the tab's number and should always start at **one**. In the above example, there are three nested tab shortcodes with tabNum starting at **one** and ending at **three** |

## Common Issues

##### One or Multiple Tabs are not Being Displayed Properly

- Make sure **tabsTotal** is equal to the total amount of tab shortcodes you have. 
- Make sure **tabNameX** exists for each tab shortcode in the tabs shortcode. 
- Make sure your nested tab shortcodes **tabNum** are in sequential order.
